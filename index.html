                        than Earth's Moon.

                        The Latest
                        Full Moon Guide: January - February 2022
                        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                        viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its
                        proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs
                        to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

                        <br><br>
                        Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to
                        rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing
                        happens in reverse at sunset.

                        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of
                        the four inner, terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s
                        similar in size and density. These are not identical twins, however – there are radical
                        differences between the two worlds.
                        <br><br>
                        Venus has crushing air pressure at its surface – more than 90 times that of Earth – similar to
                        the pressure you'd encounter a mile below the ocean on Earth.

                        <br><br>
                        Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide and it’s perpetually shrouded in
                        thick, yellowish clouds of sulfuric acid that trap heat, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.
                        It’s the hottest planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Surface
                        temperatures on Venus are about 900 degrees Fahrenheit (475 degrees Celsius) – hot enough to
                        melt lead. The surface is a rusty color and it’s peppered with intensely crunched mountains and
                        thousands of large volcanoes. Scientists think it’s possible some volcanoes are still active.

                        <br><br>
                        While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our
                        solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is
                        the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

                        <br><br>
                        The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named
                        after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which
                        simply means “the ground.”

                        by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.

                        Uranus is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were a large apple, Uranus would be the

                        Uranus takes about 17 hours to rotate once (a Uranian day), and about 84 Earth years to complete
                        an orbit of the Sun (a Uranian year).

                        Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant
                        planet in our solar system.
                        <br><br>
                        Neptune takes about 16 hours to rotate once (a Neptunian day), and about 165 Earth years to
                        orbit the sun (a Neptunian year).Neptune orbits our Sun, a star, and is the eighth planet from
                        the Sun at a distance of about 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers).
                        Neptune is an ice giant. Most of its mass is a hot, dense fluid of "icy" materials – water,
                        methane and ammonia – above a small rocky core.
                        <br><br>
                        Neptune's atmosphere is made up mostly of molecular hydrogen, atomic helium and methane.
                        Neptune has at least five main rings and four more ring arcs, which are clumps of dust and
                        debris likely formed by the gravity of a nearby moon.
                        Neptune has 14 known moons which are named after sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.
